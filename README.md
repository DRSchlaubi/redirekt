# redirekt

Simple redirect server with some markdown implementation stuff.

It uses [this style sheet](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css/) for displaying markdown.

## To do

* Make uploading files for file server possible
* Fix GitHub Markdown API error when reading from markdown file
* Documentation
* Dashboard implementation:
  * Edit, delete redirects
  * some html/style so it doesn't look like it was made 20 years ago
* i18n
* multiple accounts possible? (roles?)
* much more, if you have an idea, open a pr / issue!
