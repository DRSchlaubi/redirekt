# redirekt

Simple redirect server with some markdown implementation stuff.

It uses [this style sheet](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css/) for displaying markdown.

## To do

* ~~Make uploading files for file server possible~~
* Fix GitHub Markdown API error when reading from markdown file
* Documentation
* Dashboard implementation:
  * Edit, delete redirects
* ~~some html/style so it doesn't look like it was made 20 years ago~~
* ~~i18n~~
* multiple accounts possible? (roles?)
* password secured redirekts (maybe also 2FA/U2F?) / account selection
* multiple files as zip/tar
* more authentication methods
* much more, if you have an idea, open a pr / issue!
